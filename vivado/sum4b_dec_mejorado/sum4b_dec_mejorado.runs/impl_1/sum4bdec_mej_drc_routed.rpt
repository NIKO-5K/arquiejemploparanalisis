2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CC2_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CC2_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell CC2_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CCS_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CCS_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell CCS_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CCS_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CCS_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell CCS_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net D2_reg[0]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin D2_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell D2_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U1_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U2_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net US__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin US_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell US_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net p_0_in is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin D1_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell D1_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net p_1_out[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CC1_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell CC1_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
