-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell D1_reg[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) D1_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell D2_reg[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) D2_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
