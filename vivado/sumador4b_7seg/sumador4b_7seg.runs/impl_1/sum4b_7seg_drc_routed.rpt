2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CC_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CC_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell CC_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CC_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CC_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell CC_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
